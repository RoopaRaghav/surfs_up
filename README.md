# Overview
To convince business shark W. Avy, I created a business plan for Surf n' Shake Shop, a surf and ice cream shop, to fund my new passion for surfing on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. This analysis focuses on the weather in the peak summer months, and the slower winter month, so that I can plan for both of these seasons and ensure the business will have smooth sailing.

# Results
## June Temperature Analysis
After running an analysis of over 1,700 recorded data points for the month of June through a 17 year period, it can be seen that there is not a great deal of temperature variations. The record low was 64 degrees, and the record high was 85 degrees. These are considered outliers, as the average temperature is 74 degrees.

## December Temperature Analysis
After running the same analysis in December, the temperatures and averages are very similar to June. The record low was 56 degrees, the record high was 83 degrees, with an average of 71 degrees.

## Summary
While comparing the analysis for June and December, W. Avy and I can conclude that on average, the temperature does not fluctuate severely. The record highs and lows are still within about 20 degrees of each other, in the most severe instances.

To grasp a deeper level of understanding of how weather may impact Surf n’ Shake in the future, more queries can be made with the weather database. W. Avy suggested that, as his last surf shop was ‘rained out of business’ , that an analysis of rainfall and its impact should also be conducted. Within this analysis, a look into hurricanes should also be conducted. This will help prepare business expenses and safety.

A third analysis of how weather has changed over time and how this can impact the island of Oahu itself, focusing on the impact of climate change. While this analysis does not need to be up to the United Nations scientific standards, this analysis can give an idea of where on the island is the safest, and has the longest predicted lifespan. This can also be used in Surf n’ Shake’s promotional materials, showing how nature conscious the business is.
